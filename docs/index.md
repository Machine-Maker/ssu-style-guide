# SSU Coding Standards / Style Guides

The Computer Science Faculty at Sonoma State University has agreed to formatting standards for programs written for courses in the department. Each style guide follows some set of generally-accepted industry best practices. Pedagogicaslly, it is intended to help students learn how to read and follow a coding standard and to learn some elements of good coding style.

## When should you follow these standards?
Faculty may establish any of these standards as operative in their course by using a citation in either a syllabus, lab, or assignment.

Individual faculty may set their own standards for programs in their courses, superseding or extending guidelines stated here. Any alternative guidelines will be stated in writing on a syllabus, individual lab, or specific assignment.

Whatever guidelines are established for a course, points from submitted work may be deducted if the guidelines are not followed, and/or a submission may be returned ungraded for widespread violations of these guidelines.
